Notice
======

Moved to crooney/dotfiles any updates will occur there.

I've gone naked: no bars, no mouse niceties.

Got solarized banging with tmux, vim and urxvt, if you care.

Hansen brothers contemplating "Old time hockey, like Gordie Howe."

====================

Shamelessly stolen and then heavily tweaked from http://github.com/brafales/xmonad-config, which is probably a better jumping off point than this, as he has a tutorial [here](http://thinkingeek.com/2011/11/21/simple-guide-configure-xmonad-dzen2-conky/).
